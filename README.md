### Why should you care?

Static is the best, but sometimes you need to fetch data from a remote source which makes things not so static. Roots mini records is a little webpack plugin intended for use with [roots-mini](https://github.com/carrot/roots-mini) which allows you to make locals pulled from a JSON file or url returning JSON available as static locals in your jade templates.
