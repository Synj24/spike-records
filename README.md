remote data -> static templates

> **Note:** This project is in early development, and versioning is a little different. [Read this](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Q) for more details.

### Why should you care?

Static is the best, but sometimes you need to fetch data from a remote source which makes things not so static. Roots mini records is a little webpack plugin intended for use with [roots-mini](https://github.com/carrot/roots-mini) which allows you to make locals pulled from a JSON file or url returning JSON available as static locals in your jade templates.

### Installation

Install into your project with `npm i roots-mini-records -S`.

Then load it up as a plugin in `app.js` like this:

```js
import RecordsPlugin from 'roots-mini-records'

export default {
  plugins: [new RecordsPlugin({ test: { file: 'data.json' } })]
}
```

### Usage

The records plugin accepts an object, and each key in the object should contain another object as it's value, with either a `file`, `url`, or `data` property. For example:

```js
new RecordsPlugin({
  one: { file: 'data.json' },
  two: { url: 'http://api.carrotcreative.com/staff' },
  three: { data: { foo: 'bar' } }
})
```

Whatever data source you provide, it will be resolved and added to your jade templates as `locals[key]`. So for example, if you were trying to access `three` in your templates, you could access it with `locals.three.foo`, and it would return `'bar'`.

Now let's get into some more details for each of the data types.

#### File

`file` accepts a file path, either absolute or relative to your roots project's root. So for the example above, it would resolve to `/path/to/project/data.json`.

### Url

`url` accepts either a string or an object. If provided with a string, it will make a request to the provided url and parse the result as JSON, then return it as a local. If you need to modify this behavior, you can pass in an object instead. The object is passed through directly to [rest.js](https://github.com/cujojs/rest), their docs for acceptable values for this object [can be found here](https://github.com/cujojs/rest/blob/master/docs/interfaces.md#common-request-properties). These options allow modification of the method, headers, params, request entity, etc. and should cover any additional needs.

### Data

The most straightforward of the options, this will just pass the data right through to the locals. Also if you provide a A+ compliant promise for a value, it will be resolved and passed in to the template.

### Additional Options

Alongside any of the data sources above, there are a few additional options you can provide in order to further manipulate the output.

#### Transform

If you want to transform the data from your source in any way before injecting it as a local, you can use this option. For example:

```js
new Records({
  blog: {
    url: 'http://blog.com/api/posts',
    transform: (data) => { return data.response.posts }
  }
})
```

#### Template

Using the template option allows you to write objects returned from records to single page templates. For example, if you are trying to render a blog as static, you might want each `post` returned from the API to be rendered as a single page by itself.

The `template` option is an object with `path` and `output` keys. `path` is an absolute or relative path to a jade template to be used to render each item, and `output` is a function with the currently iterated item as a parameter, which should return a string representing a path relative to the project root where the single view should be rendered. For example:

```js
new Records({
  blog: {
    url: 'http://blog.com/api/posts',
    template: {
      path: 'templates/single.jade',
      output: (post) => { return `posts/${post.slug}.html` }
    }
  }
})
```

Note that for this feature to work correctly, the data returned from your data source must be an array. If it's not, the plugin will throw an error. If you need to transform the data before it is rendered into templates, you can do so using a `transform` function, as such:

```js
new Records({
  blog: {
    url: 'http://blog.com/api/posts',
    template: {
      transform: (data) => { return data.response.posts }
      path: 'templates/single.jade',
      output: (post) => { return `posts/${post.slug}.html` }
    }
  }
})
```

If you use a `transform` function outside of the `template` block, this will still work. The difference is that a `transform` inside the `template` block will only use the transformed data for rendering single templates, whereas the normal `transform` option will alter that data that is injected into your view templates as locals, as well as the single templates.

Inside your template, a local called `item` will be injected, which contains the contents of the item for which the template has been rendered. It will also contain all the other locals injected by roots-mini-records and otherwise, fully transformed by any `transform` functions provided.
